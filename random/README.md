# Colorful Turtle Graphics Pattern

This repository contains a Python script that generates a vibrant, hypnotic pattern using Python’s built‑in `turtle` graphics library and the `colorsys` module.
The design combines geometric repetition with smooth HSV color transitions to create a dynamic rainbow effect.

# Features
- Creates a **multi‑layered circular pattern** with rainbow hues.
- Uses **HSV to RGB conversion** for smooth color gradients.
- Runs at high drawing speed for quick visualization.
- Produces a mesmerizing, animated design on a black background.

# Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.7+** installed.
- No external libraries are required beyond the standard library (`turtle`, `colorsys`).

# Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
   bash:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-color-pattern.git
   cd turtle-color-pattern
   
2. Run the Script
   bash:
   python turtle_pattern.py
   
3. Watch the Animation
   A window will open, and the turtle will draw the colorful pattern step by step.

# File Structure
.
├── turtle_pattern.py   # Main script for generating the pattern
└── README.md           # Documentation

# Output
The script produces a **rainbow‑like circular pattern** with nested arcs, resembling a kaleidoscope effect. 
Each iteration shifts the hue slightly, resulting in a smooth gradient across the design.
