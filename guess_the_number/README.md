# Name Guessing Game

A simple Python mini-project where the program thinks of a name (`Harrison`) and the player tries to guess it.  
With each wrong guess, the program provides a hint by revealing one letter of the name in sequence.

# How It Works
1. The program stores a secret name (`Harrison`).
2. The user is prompted to guess the name.
3. If the guess is wrong:
   - The program reveals the next letter of the name as a hint.
   - The user is asked to guess again.
4. The game continues until:
   - The user guesses the name correctly, or
   - All letters have been revealed.
